# Speech Recognition Project Readme

Welcome to the Speech Recognition Project, where we leverage Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to achieve an impressive 88% accuracy in converting spoken language to written text. Our approach involves the utilization of GMMs for modeling the statistical distribution of audio features. The training process involves optimizing GMM parameters, and the model is evaluated using a diverse dataset. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the recognition script.
